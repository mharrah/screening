Some considerations:
1. Requires:
    1. Powershell 5.1 (Windows)
    2. Pester
2. Guidence:
    1. Make as many unit tests pass as you can. *Do not worry* about scores or "the right answers".
    2. Do *not* change the unit tests inside `tests/`. Fix the functions inside `sut/` unless comments specify otherwise.
    3. *Make comments* on both tests you fix and ones you can't. What is important is your reasoning.
